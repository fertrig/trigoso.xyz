### Act 1

Just a few minutes ago he was rocking comfortably on the porch and admiring his latest creation--his chicken coup. Now he is breathing heavily and silently, his face is tense, his neck stiff, his body is still. He swallows hard: a chicken is missing.

The next few hours torment him. How could this happen! “What if my design for the chicken coup is not good? What if it's all wrong!” He ponders these questions without answering them.

He doesn't remember sleeping that night but he wakes up thinking, "maybe I miscounted". He liked that thought. 

As the days go by he feels calmer and eventually he forgets what happened.

One evening he is rocking again on the porch, staring at the blue, white, and yellow sky. Feeling peaceful. Then, a sudden gust of wind masks a wild rustling of feathers in the coup. He gets up to inspect the coup. As soon as he walks in he sees a group of white feathers slowly descending mid air. He desperately counts the chickens again—another chicken is missing.

His palms are on his face. His stomach is wrenching. He thinks of his friends. How will they see him now? Fuck. Finally he whispers: “I'm going to have to talk to my dad.”
