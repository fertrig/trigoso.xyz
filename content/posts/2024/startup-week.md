Early this week, a good friend reminded me: "Hey, are you going to [Startup Week](https://www.raleighdurhamstartupweek.com/)?". 

That question kicked off a lot of learning and discovery for me. I attended and I listened 
to seasoned founders share their story and their energy. I also met interesting 
people and some potential business opportunities.

One talk reinforced the healthy tension between strictness and defiance that has been
brewing in my head lately. It also talked about mental health and how critical that is
for a founder.

Founder values were a big theme. Those values will spread to the rest of the 
organization as it grows. It's important to be intentional, aware, and explicit
about your values.

A talk mentioned the entrepreneur stereotype of the hustle, the grind, the scarcity
mentality. The speaker challenged us to reject that mental model.

Other speakers shared how lucky they got, what their abyss looked like, how they pivoted, how much 
they value transparency. They shared the highs and lows, and how addictive it can be.

A couple of good reads:

- [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/) which will help you ask the right questions
  to validate your business.
- [Democratizing Knowledge](https://www.hustlefund.vc/e-book), wisdom and insights on what it 
  takes to build a startup.
