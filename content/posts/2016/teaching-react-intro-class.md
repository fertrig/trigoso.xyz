I have been teaching a React Intro class over at [codementor.io](http://codementor.io/).

By the end of this course I hope students will have hands-on experience using React and Flux. We are building a real-time chat application which will provide a real sense of how to build apps the React way.

In this class, students will learn:

* React,
* Flux,
* routing and animations with React,
* Webpack,
* ES6,
* debugging React,and
* creating reusable components.

Here's the syllabus for the class.

###### Lesson 2 - Managing Data and Actions using Flux
