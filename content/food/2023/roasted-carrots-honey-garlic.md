Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYfoARhooHE).

Heat oven to 400. Peel and cut carrots into 3 inches. Enough carrots to cover the skillet surface. Slice any thick chunks in half so they cook more or less evenly. Mince garlic.

In skillet, stainless steel worked well, melt 1 stick of butter, add honey, probably 3 to 5 tablespoons, add garlic, then salt. Satee it a bit. Then throw carrots in there. Crack pepper over them. Satee carrots a bit, moving them around so the sauce covers them. Taste the sauce. Add more of whatever is needed. When you have a nice flavor put skillet in oven.

Put skillet in oven for 20 minutes. Carrots should not be too soft. Cover them until ready to seve.

They were delicious over rice.
