Pour kale into a giant bowl.  
Take out rough stems.  
Massage kale with enough olive oil that it glistens and softens but isn’t saturated. Add some salt but not too much. Let that sit for 20-30 minutes if you have time. If not just massage more by hand and it will soften.  

Dressing: 
Mix olive oil and half a large lemon. More oil than lemon. Taste and see.  
Add a bit of honey or maple syrup to cut the acidity and add depth.  
Add a bit of Dijon mustard if you have it (you don’t right now).  
Add salt and pepper.  

Add dressing and grate fresh Parmesan cheese all over the salad and mix it in. That can sit for 5-10 mins or you can serve it right away. I add avocado and more cheese on top right when you’re ready to eat.  

This is the [closest recipe](https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-vinaigrette/#wprm-recipe-container-48434) I could find for what I do. Garlic is a good addition. I’ve done it before but I don’t do it often. 

It balances a roasted chicken very well.
