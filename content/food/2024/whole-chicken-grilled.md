- 1 whole chicken
- 1/2 cup vinegar
- 3 tbsp aji panca, or Gochujang (play with the amount still)
- 1.5 tbsp of garlic paste (smash it)
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- ground black pepper
- cumin
- lemons (maybe)

I'm trying to do the marinade without salt because I want the salt on the chicken 
so I can calculate it better. Thus figure out how to apply the salt and the marinate to 
the chicken. I'd probably do the marinade first on both sides and then the salt, or dry-brine 
it the day before and marinade it the morning of.

Mix marinade without salt: vinegar, aji paste, garlic paste soy sauce, 
vegetable oil, black pepper, cumin. 

Put in the fridge or marinade for a few hours, no more than 24 hours. Try using lime juice 
in the marinade, specially if the marination time is not too long. If left marinating 
for too long, the meat can turn mushy.

Once ready, bring chicken to room temperature. Then get grill going. Put hot charcoals
around the sides of the grill, or along the sides of the griddle (indirect heat). 
When griddle is hot, place chicken skin side down first. Leave it there for 4 minutes 
(test time: it may need more or less, last time I did 3 minutes and it was almost perfect). 
Then flip. Pinch it with thermometer, close lid, relax.
