- Leftover roasted chicken
- Broccoli
- Mushrooms
- Stock
- Sour cream
- Onion
- Garlic

Remove chicken from bones, dice it.

Cut broccoli in halves so they are not too big in the soup.

Dice mushrooms, not too thin.

Saut√© chopped onions and garlic in olive oil, let it cook, add salt, taste. Don't rush it.

The amount of liquid depends on how many servings you need. The ratio is around 4:2:2:1 for stock:chicken:broccoli:mushrooms. You can always add a cup of water.

Add stock, chicken, broccoli, mushrooms. Bring it to a simmer, don't let it boil too much. Simmer for 7 minutes or until the mushrooms reduce.

Add salt as needed. If the stock is unsalted, then add about a pinch of salt per cup of stock. Taste.

When ready, serve in bowls, then add a dollop of sour cream in each bowl. Mix it and enjoy.

Don't put the sour cream in the pot because it could curdle and it is more difficult to store leftovers and reheat without curdling.
