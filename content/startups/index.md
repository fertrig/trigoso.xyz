Since 2014 I have worked for 6 startups. I enjoy my work. I feel lucky I get to do it every day.

<br/>

Some of my startup work:

- [Tissue Health Plus](https://tissuehealthplus.com): I led the front-end development in mobile and web. I also reorganized their team and process.
- [Monarch](https://monarchapp.io): I created and built this developer tool.
- [Dropsource](https://www.dropsource.com/platform): I built the technology for this complex software product. I also helped with UX.
- **Project 1040**: I validated the business model, managed the project, designed the domain model, hired contractors, and oversaw the design of the MVP for this tax planning system.
- **ArgusQ**: I designed the UX of the MVP and developed the technology for this crowd sourcing platform.
- [marGo](https://margo.me/): I built all aspects of the technology for this direct marketing SaaS platform.
- **Dobly**: a team communications tool before Slack became what it is today.
